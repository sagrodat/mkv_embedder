# MKV Embedder

MKV Embedder is a simple command-line tool designed to embed additional information into MKV video files and extract it later. The main goal is to allow MKV files to contain more than just video dataâ€”now they can hold extra files (currently ZIP attachments) that may contain metadata or supplementary content.

## Features

- **Embed Attachments:** Insert a ZIP file as an attachment into an MKV video.
- **Extract Attachments:** Retrieve the embedded ZIP file from an MKV video.
- **Size Limiting:** Optionally enforce a maximum total size (in MB) for the video and attachment combined.
- **Testing Samples:** The `sample_videos` folder contains small MKV snippets (around 5 seconds each and under 500KB) that you can use for testing or future storage.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mkv_embedder.git
    cd mkv_embedder
    ```
    
2. **Ensure Dependencies:**
    - This tool requires Python 3.
    - The MKV utilities (`mkvmerge.exe`, `mkvextract.exe`, `mkvinfo.exe`) must be present in the `bin` directory. If they are missing, download and place them there.

## Usage

The tool operates via the command line with two main commands: `embed` and `extract`.

### Embedding an Attachment

To embed a ZIP file into an MKV video, run:

```
python mkv_embedder.py embed -i path/to/input.mkv -a path/to/attachment.zip -o path/to/output.mkv -m 50
```

- `i` / `-input`: Path to the input MKV video file.
- `a` / `-attachment`: Path to the ZIP file to embed.
- `o` / `-output`: Path where the output MKV (with the embedded attachment) will be saved.
- `m` / `-max-size`: (Optional) Maximum allowed total size in MB for the combined video and attachment.

### Extracting an Attachment

To extract an embedded attachment from an MKV video, run:

```
python mkv_embedder.py extract -i path/to/input_with_attachment.mkv
```

- `i` / `-input`: Path to the MKV file from which to extract the attachment.

## Notes

- The tool checks if the combined size of the video and the attachment exceeds the provided maximum size (if set) and aborts if it does.
- If the required MKV utilities are not found in the `bin` directory, the tool will exit with an error message.
- Detailed error messages are provided to help diagnose any issues during embedding or extraction.
